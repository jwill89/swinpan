                <h3>What We Are</h3>

                <p>The <strong>Southwestern Indiana Partnership Action Network</strong> is a simple idea. We are a hub, a database for groups and organizations in Southwestern Indiana to list

                    themselves and find other groups to coordinate with, fostering an atmosphere of community, helping Hoosiers in the region by getting involved directly

                    at the community level across a wide variety of interests, issues, and causes. We are also here to provide a gateway for any resident of Southwestern

                    Indiana looking to turn their passion into real action.</p>

                <h3>What We Are Not</h3>

                <p><strong>We are not in any way a partisan or political group</strong>. We do not affiliate with any political party, however political entities may apply to be a partnered organization and work

                    with other groups as necessary. We do not have any official stances on any issues, on any politicians, on any laws. We are a database, a tool designed to

                    help local people find groups that fit their interests, and help local groups find each other to foster partnerships and awareness.</p>
